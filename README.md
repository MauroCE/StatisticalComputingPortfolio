# StatisticalComputingPortfolio
Code and various files for the Statistical Computing 1 portfolio at the University of Bristol

Each folder in this repository represents one of the chapters in the Statistical Computing [website](https://awllee.github.io/sc1-2019/)
which is a first year PhD research course at the [University of Bristol](www.bris.ac.uk) for the program of Computational
Statistics and Data Science ([COMPASS PhD](http://www.bris.ac.uk/maths/postgraduate/compass/)).

The main goal of this repository is to contain Rmarkdown files that show that I have interacted with the material of the course.
In addition to Rmarkdown files, there will be Bibliography files for LaTeX and possibly Rscripts.
