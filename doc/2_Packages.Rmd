## Creating an R Package with RStudio
To Create a package open RStudio, on the menu browse

```
File > New Project > New Directory
```

![](images/CreateProject.png)

Then, from the following options choose `R Package`.

![](images/RPackageScreen.png)

At this point, we need to assign the R Package a name and tell RStudio where to place the main folder containing our package files without our folder structure. Here, I've chosen to put it under the folder `University` and to call it `PerfectRPackage`.

![](images/RPackageDirectory.png)

After this, RStudio will open a new session that should look like the following one, with a `hello.R` file and with a lot of new content such as

* `.Rbuildignore`
* `.Rproj.user`
* `DESCRIPTION`
* `man`
* `NAMESPACE`
* `PerfectRPackage.Rproj`
* `R`

![](images/RPackageWelcomeScreen.png)

Now it's time to create a GitHub repository. Browse inside the package directory, in this case called `PerfectRPackage` on the terminal. Type `git init` to initialize a repository, then follow it with `git add .` to stage all the new files created by RStudio when it created the package. Then, commit these staged changes using `git commit -m""` and put some helpful message in between `""`. It should look something like this

![](images/TerminalGit.png)

Now we need to create an upstream repository on GitHub. To do that, go on www.github.com, log in and click on the green button `New` to create a new repository

![](images/GitHubNewRepoButton.png)

you will be directed to the following page where you can specify the name of the GitHub repository and add other details. I suggest naming it with the same name of the RPackage, in this case `PerfectRPackage`, to add a useful description, keep it Public, and to not initialize it with a README.md file just yet. Finally, click on the green button at the bottom saying `Create Repository`

![](images/NewRepository.png)

Scroll to the bottom, and copy the following commands 

![](images/GitPushExistingRepo.png)

Now go back to your terminal, paste the commmands and this will connect the repository upstream.

![](images/GitAddedRepository.png)

Next, we want to add a `README.md` file. This will be the "welcome page" of our GitHub repository. To do so, simply go on the `PerfectRPackage` repository on GitHub and click on `Create New File` button on the right of the screen. This will load the following page. Call your file `README.md` and write some useful description.

![](images/readme.png)

Next, scroll to the bottom of the page, add a comment to describe what you're doing and commit to the master branch, as show in the following screenshot.

![](images/commitreadme.png)

Click `Commit new file`. Next, we need to get these changes on our local version of the repository, so open up the terminal in the package directory, which is `PerfectRPackage` in this case. Type in `git status` to see what's going on in your local repository. If everything is up to date and you don't have any changes pending to be staged, simply type `git pull`. Otherwise, add your changes by typing `git add .` and then commit them with some useful message, using the command `git commit -m""` as shown below.

![](images/GitCommittingChangesBeforePulling.png)

Next type 

```
git fetch origin --prune
```

followed by 

```
git rebase --preserve-merges origin/master
```

This will allow you to finally push your changes using `git push`.

### Testing, Documentation, Licensing and README.md

First of all, we need to install some packages. Open RStudio, go to the console and type

```
install.packages(c("devtools", "roxygen2", "testthat", "knitr"))
```

When they're finished installing, simply load the `devtools` package by typing

```
library(devtools)
```

Now we want to add an author to the package. So type in something like this

```
mauro <- person(given="Mauro", family="Camara Escudero", email="maurocamaraescudero@gmail.com")
```

and assign it to the `author` variable by typing 

```
devtools.desc.author = mauro
```

Now it's time to add a LICENCE to our Package. The easiest way to add an MIT license is to type 

```
use_mit_license("Mauro Camara Escudero")
```

Now, we can add some documentation with Roxygen. To do this, simply open the `hello.R` script and click anywhere on the body of the `hello` function. Then, in the menu click

```
Code > Insert roxygen skeleton
```

To add a documentation skeleton. Remember to save the R script file. Now it's time to actually create the documentation. Since the file `NAMESPACE` was created by RStudio and not by Roxygen, we can delete such file for now. Then, go to the console and type 

```
document()
```

This will re-create the `NAMESPACE` file and add a new folder called `man`, containing markdown documents with the documentation. The next thing to do is to install the package. Go to the console and type 

``` 
install()
```

Next, we want to create some tests. Type

```
use_testthat()
```

and you should get an output that looks like this

![](images/usetestthat.png)

To create a new test file for the function `hello` go to the console and type 

```
use_test("hello")
```
This will create a new file called `test-hello.R`, which will look like this

![](images/testhello.png)

Modify this function to do a sensible test. For instance, give a sensible name and check that the function `hello` actually prints `Hello, World!`. It should look like this:

![](images/testfunctionsensible.png)

Now we can actually test our function. To do so, go to the console, load the `testthat` package by typing

```
library(testthat)
```

Then load the `PerfectRPackage` in the console by typing

```
load_all()
```

and test it using

```
test()
```

Hopefully, the test will be fine and you should obtain a summary of the testing that looks like this:

![](images/testingpackage.png)

At this point you could push all the new changes to the upstream repository. Notice that if you did not create a `README.md` file, you can create it now together with its RMarkdown version by typing the following in the console

```
use_readme_rmd()
```

If you do this, remember to re-knit the README document before committing the changes. 

### Travis for Continuous Integration

To do continuous deployment, go on https://travis-ci.com/ and login with your GitHub account, granting access to the repositories for which you want continuous development. Next, create a new text file called `.travis.yml` and paste the following content

```
language: r
dist: xenial
cache: packages
branches:
  only:
    - master

r_github_packages:
  - r-lib/covr

after_success:
  - Rscript -e 'covr::codecov()'
```

commit the changes. From the **next** commit, travis will start building and testing your package. Go on the travis website and you should be able to see a screen looking like this

![](images/travisbuild.png)

### Adding travis badge to GitHub readme

If you want to add a badge to your README.md file, simply go on the travis website shown above and click on the badge saying `build unknown`. Select `Markdown`

![](images/badgemd.png)

Copy the text in the last cell, go into your `README.rmd` file and type it under the comments saying where to add the badge, like shown in the picture below

![](images/addbadgetormd.png)

Save the RMarkdown file. If everything went well, in the travis website you should now see a successful build. 

![](images/travisbuildsuccessful.png)


Finally, knit the `README.rmd` and then push your changes to the upstream directory, and you should then be able to see the badge on your README.md file on GitHub.

### Hosting a Website with Travis on GitHub pages

Go to GitHub and click on your profile image on the top right corner to toggle the menu. Click on `Settings` and then click to the bottom option `Developer Settings`. Here, click on `Personal access tokens` and click on `Generate new token`. Make sure that `public_repo` is selected.

![](images/tokengithubpublicrepo.png)

Copy the token and go to the travis website. In the successful build, click on `More options` on the right of the screen and choose `Settings`. 


Scroll down to `Environment Variables`. Here, choose a name that will be used as a variable holding your personal access token. For instance  `GITHUB_PAT` and paste your Personal Access Token from github in the `value` box. Then click `Add`. In the following screenshot I show you where you should be adding this information, without actually adding it for security reasons

![](images/envvartravis.png)

Now go into the `.travis.yml` file and change the content to 

```
language: r
dist: xenial
cache: packages
branches:
    only:
        - master
r_packages:
    - rmarkdown

script:
    - Rscript -e 'rmarkdown::render("website.Rmd", output_dir="public")'

deploy:
    provider: pages
    skip_cleanup: true
    github_token: $GITHUB_PAT
    on:
        branch: master
    local_dir: public
    target_branch: gh-pages
```

Make sure that the setting `github_token` is set to the same name that you've given to the github token on travis, in this case `GITHUB_PAT`. Notice how we've set `target_branch: gh-pages`. Go on GitHub and create a new branch called `gh-pages`. To do so, click `Branch:master` type `gh-pages` and click at the bottom where it says `Create branch: gh-pages`.

![](images/ghpagescreation.png)

Finally, notice how we've told travis to build the website for `website.Rmd` RMarkdown file. This doesn't exist yet, so we'll create it now. Go to RStudio and create such file in the main folder `PerfectRPackage'. 

![](images/websitermd.png)

Finally, add, commit and push the changes so that travis can build the website. When travis build will be successful, your website will be available at https://mauroce.github.io/PerfectRPackage/website.html. 

### Adding Codecov Badge
To add a codecov badge, go to www.codecov.io and login with github. In the `PerfectRPackage` repository click on `Settings` and on `Badge` on the left hand side of the screen. Copy the code under Markdown, as shown below

![](images/codecovbadge.png)

and paste it under the travis build badge on the `README.Rmd` file. Knit it, add the changes, commit them and push them. If the build is successful, you should see a codecov badge on your `README.md` file on GitHub.
